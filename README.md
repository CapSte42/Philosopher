# **philo**
I never thought philosophy would be so deadly

## **Project overview**
The **philo** project is an essential part of the **42 curriculum**.
It tasks students with creating a simulation of the dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes.
This project aims to improve understanding of concurrency, synchronization, and efficient coding practices in C.

#### **Objective**
- **Simulate Philosophers' Dining**: Implement a simulation where philosophers alternately eat, think, and sleep, using shared resources (forks).
- **Thread Management**: Create threads for each philosopher and ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions.
- **Mutex Usage**: Use mutexes to manage access to shared resources (forks) and prevent data races.
- **Monitor Philosopher State**: Use an external thread to monitor the state of philosophers and ensure they don't starve.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure thorough error handling to prevent unexpected crashes (segmentation faults, bus errors, etc.).
- **Memory Management**: Properly manage dynamic memory allocation to avoid memory leaks.

#### **Key features**
- **Philosopher Threads**: Each philosopher is represented by a separate thread.
- **Fork Management**: Use mutexes to manage access to forks and ensure proper synchronization.
- **State Monitoring**: An external thread monitors the state of each philosopher to ensure they do not starve.
- **Logging State Changes**: Log state changes (eating, thinking, sleeping) with timestamps to track the behavior of philosophers.

#### **Compiling the Project**
The **philo** project includes a Makefile for easy compilation. Simply run:
xxx
make
xxx
This will generate the `philo` executable.

#### **Running the Project**
To start the simulation, run:
```
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
Example:
```
./philo 4 800 200 200
```

#### **Project Details**
- **Philosopher States**: Philosophers can be in one of three states: eating, thinking, or sleeping. They need two forks to eat and release the forks after eating.
- **Synchronization**: Mutexes are used to ensure that no two philosophers can hold the same fork at the same time.
- **State Monitoring**: An external thread monitors the state of philosophers and logs state changes. This thread ensures that no philosopher starves.
